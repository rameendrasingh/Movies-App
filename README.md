## Get Started

install dev dependencies

### `npm install`

## Then Fetch the API

For this go to https://www.themoviedb.org, create an account and get the api key after signing up and filling some personal information, then use that api key in constants/index.js file

## Then

Run The app

### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode. for EXPO run this command "npx expo start", if this gives you an error then first install expo by pasting the command "npm install expo"

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start` / `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).
